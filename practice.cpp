/*Q2 (last names beginning in O-Z): Write complete C++ program that asks the user to enter temperature in Celsius stored as a floating point number and outputs the temperature value in Fahrenheit as a floating point number. The formula to convert Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit temperature is:

F = 9/5*C + 32

Where F is the Fahrenheit temperature and C is the Celsius temperature.

Sample run:

Enter temperature in Celsius: 25.6

(Program outputs) 25.6 degree Celsius in Fahrenheit is x (youâ€™ll fill in the correct value for x)

    cout << endl << c << " degree Celsius in Fahrenheit is " << f << ". \n";
